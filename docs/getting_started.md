## Initializing Your Workspace

ResumeCraftr operates within a dedicated workspace directory called `cv-workspace`. To set up this workspace, run:

```bash
resumecraftr setup --language EN --gpt-model gpt-4o-mini
```

### Key Options:
- `--language`: Sets the primary language of your CV (e.g., `EN` for English or `ES` for Spanish).
- `--gpt-model`: Specifies the GPT model to use. For testing, we recommend using `gpt-4o-mini`.

This will create the `cv-workspace` directory with the following files:
- **`cv-workspace/resume_template.md`**: The Markdown template used for PDF generation. You can modify this file to customize the CV layout and style.
- **`cv-workspace/resumecraftr.json`**: The main configuration file.
- **`cv-workspace/custom.md`**: A file for adding supplementary information and custom instructions for ChatGPT.

---

### Understanding `resumecraftr.json`

Here's an example of a `resumecraftr.json` configuration file:

```json
{
    "primary_language": "ES",
    "output_format": "pdf",
    "template_name": "resume_template.md",
    "chat_gpt": {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "temperature": 0.7,
        "top_p": 1.0
    },
    "extracted_files": [
        "Rodrigo Estrada CV ES.txt"
    ],
    "job_descriptions": [
        "Principal Engineer Verne.txt"
    ]
}
```

- **`primary_language`**: The language of the CV and job descriptions (e.g., `EN`, `ES`).
- **`output_format`**: Output format, typically `pdf`.
- **`template_name`**: Name of the Markdown template used for PDF generation.
- **`chat_gpt`**: OpenAI settings such as the model, temperature, and top_p.
- **`extracted_files`**: List of extracted text files from your CVs.
- **`job_descriptions`**: List of job description files used for optimization.

---

### `custom.md`

The `custom.md` file is a powerful tool where you can add:
- **Supplementary information** that may not be in your CV (e.g., achievements, side projects).
- **Additional instructions** for ChatGPT to tailor the CV optimization further.

Make sure to keep this file updated with relevant details to enhance your CV optimization process.

## Creating a CV from Scratch

ResumeCraftr now allows you to create a CV from scratch without needing to parse an existing document. This is useful for building a new resume or updating specific sections.

### Creating a New CV

To create a new CV, run:

```bash
resumecraftr new-cv my_cv
```

This command creates a new CV with the name `my_cv` and initializes all sections with empty values.

### Available Sections

ResumeCraftr supports the following sections that you can add to your CV:

1. **Contact Information** - Personal details like name, email, phone, location, and website
2. **Professional Summary** - A brief overview of your professional background and career objectives
3. **Work Experience** - Detailed information about your employment history
4. **Education** - Academic background, degrees, and certifications
5. **Skills** - Technical and soft skills relevant to your field
6. **Projects** - Notable projects you've worked on
7. **Publications** - Any articles, papers, or books you've authored
8. **Awards & Achievements** - Recognition and accomplishments
9. **Languages** - Language proficiencies
10. **Volunteer Experience** - Community service and volunteer work
11. **References** - Professional references (optional)
12. **Custom Section** - Any additional section you'd like to include

### Adding or Updating Sections

To add or update a specific section in your CV, run:

```bash
resumecraftr edit-section my_cv "Work Experience"
```

This command will guide you through the process of adding or updating the specified section. You can add multiple entries for sections like Work Experience, Projects, Education, etc.

### Viewing Your CV

To view the contents of your CV, run:

```bash
resumecraftr view-cv my_cv
```

This command displays all sections of your CV in a structured format.

---

## Importing and Parsing Resumes

ResumeCraftr can import text from supported document formats (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.md`). Place your CV inside `cv-workspace` and run:

```bash
resumecraftr import-cv /path/to/Resume.pdf
```

This will generate a `.txt` file containing the extracted raw text.

### Parsing into Structured Sections

To classify the imported resume text into structured sections such as contact details, experience, skills, and education, use:

```bash
resumecraftr parse-cv
```

This command creates an `.extracted_sections.json` file, which contains a structured version of your CV, making it easier to optimize.

---

## Adding a Job Description and Tailoring Your Resume

### Adding a Job Description
To tailor your resume for a specific job description, run:

```bash
resumecraftr add-job
```

This will prompt you to either paste the job description directly or provide a file containing the job description.

### Tailoring the Resume
After adding the job description, tailor the resume with:

```bash
resumecraftr tailor-cv
```

This step ensures that your resume highlights relevant skills and experience based on the job description. ResumeCraftr uses OpenAI to rewrite and structure the content to be ATS-friendly.

### Language Optimization

One of the key benefits of the tailor command is that it rewrites all content in the language you configured during initialization. This means:

- **Grammar and Spelling**: The AI automatically corrects grammatical errors and spelling mistakes
- **Language Consistency**: Ensures all content follows the same language style and conventions
- **Professional Tone**: Adjusts the writing to maintain a professional tone appropriate for resumes
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Adapts content to match the cultural expectations of the target language

For example, if you configured ResumeCraftr with `--language ES` (Spanish), the tailor command will rewrite your resume in proper Spanish, correcting any language errors and ensuring it follows Spanish resume conventions.

## Exporting Your Resume to PDF

Once you're satisfied with your resume, you can export it to PDF using:

```bash
resumecraftr export-pdf
```

By default, the resume will be generated in the language specified in your `resumecraftr.json` file (set during the `setup` command). If you want to generate the resume in a different language, use the `--translate` option:

```bash
resumecraftr export-pdf --translate EN  # Generate in English
resumecraftr export-pdf --translate ES  # Generate in Spanish
```

The command will:
1. Find all `.extracted_sections.json` files in your workspace
2. Let you choose which one to use if multiple files exist
3. Generate a Markdown file and convert it to PDF using Pandoc
4. Save the resulting PDF in your workspace

The PDF will be formatted according to the template in `resume_template.md`, which you can customize to match your preferred style.

### 5. Exportar a PDF
```bash
# Exportar a PDF (requiere Pandoc y LaTeX)
resumecraftr export-pdf

# Exportar a PDF en espa√±ol
resumecraftr export-pdf --translate ES

# Exportar a PDF usando un archivo Markdown existente (sin llamar a OpenAI)
resumecraftr export-pdf --skip-md-gen
```

La opci√≥n `--skip-md-gen` es especialmente √∫til cuando:
- Necesitas depurar problemas con Pandoc/LaTeX sin tener que esperar a la generaci√≥n del Markdown
- Quieres hacer ajustes manuales al archivo Markdown y volver a generar el PDF r√°pidamente
- Ya tienes un archivo Markdown que quieres usar directamente
