MARKDOWN_PROMPT = r"""
You are an expert at generating Markdown documents for ATS-friendly resumes. Your task is to generate a well-formatted Markdown file based on the provided CV text, optimized CV sections, and the job description.

### Instructions:
1. Use the provided **Markdown template** structure to generate the final document.
2. Populate all sections using:
   - **Original CV text**: Use it to recover missing details that may have been lost in optimization.
   - **Optimized CV sections**: These are rewritten for ATS but may lack important details.
   - **Job Description**: Ensure the resume aligns well with the job posting.
3. **Prioritize and expand on relevant experience**:
   - Highlight and **fully elaborate** on work experience that is directly related to the job description.
   - Ensure that all key achievements, technologies used, and detailed responsibilities are included.
   - Do not summarize key experiences; keep descriptions **as detailed as possible**.
   - For non-relevant jobs, provide a shorter summary but still retain key points.
4. Ensure the Markdown output is **properly structured**, with:
   - Bullet points where appropriate (using `-` or `*`).
   - Proper heading levels (using `#`, `##`, etc.).
   - Proper text formatting to keep it **clean and professional**.
5. Do **not** introduce information that does not exist in the original CV or optimized sections, but you may infer relevant details when appropriate.
6. Maintain an **ATS-friendly format**, avoiding excessive styling while keeping it readable.
7. Ensure the output is **pure Markdown code**, without code block wrappers (e.g., no triple backticks ` ``` `).
8. Do not include explanations or metadata, only return the final Markdown document.
